# Computer Science/Engineering Contact Points

This website serves as an entry point for aspiring graduate students (and post-docs) who are searching for positions in the broad field of information security. The list is intentionally global in scale and our hope is that we can help to increase the number of students applying to undertake doctoral studies in this area.

**We are looking to update the positions that we have available for new students. All past positions displayed on this website/in the original [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17r18cKaMSeZF4fI7UZYV0QwCvdbEb3vy3BMNZfgbgzI/edit) have been moved to [PAST-POSITIONS.md](https://github.com/alxdavids/comp-sci-phd-contacts/blob/master/PAST-POSITIONS.md). If a previously advertised position is still active, inform us using the method [below](#adding-entries-to-list).**

Below, organised by country, and then by name, please find a list of academics who are willing to act as a contact point to discuss opportunities in PhD and Masters programmes in Information Security. They may also be willing to discuss postdoc opportunities.

This list has grown from the initial list started by Kenny Paterson and Emiliano De Cristofaro for finding funded PhD places for people affected by the US ban on travel.
