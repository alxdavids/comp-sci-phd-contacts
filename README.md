This page serves as an entry point for aspiring graduate students (and post-docs) who are looking for positions in the broad field of *information security*. We are maintaining an up-to-date [list](#current-positions) of contacts who are advertising current positions in the field.

## Background
Originally, this list was created to quickly advertise positions for students affected by the US travel bans.
All past positions displayed on this website (and in the original [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17r18cKaMSeZF4fI7UZYV0QwCvdbEb3vy3BMNZfgbgzI/edit)) have been moved [here](https://github.com/alxdavids/info-sec-contacts/blob/master/PAST-POSITIONS.md). *If a previously advertised position is still active, please inform us using the method [below](#adding-entries-to-list).*

## Available positions

### PhD Studentship: Understanding, Measuring and Improving the Security of Collaboration Tools

*Contact name*: Steven Murdoch

*Location*: London, UK

*Institution*: University College London

*Contact information*: <http://murdoch.is/#contact>

*Research areas of interest*: privacy, anonymous communications, cryptography, usability

*Positions available*:

>Whenever you communicate with someone electronically there are intermediaries that process and carry your communication, helping it reliably get to the intended destination, or storing it until the recipient goes online to collect it. We hope that these intermediaries behave properly, but sometimes they get hacked, or the people running them act maliciously, and your communications can then be tampered with and eavesdropped, with potentially severe consequences. End-to-end encryption is designed to protect against such threats and has been available for decades, but it’s still rarely used because it interferes with modern ways of working. For example, if the company that provides your email service can’t read it, you can’t search it without downloading it all; with collaboration applications, like Google Docs or chat applications, current end-to-end encryption approaches won't even work. Even if data is encrypted end-to-end, analysis of the meta-data can still violate privacy, for example disclosing who is working with whom. Anonymous communication systems like Tor can help protect meta-data but the delay that the most secure systems (e.g. Loopix) introduce would prevent standard collaboration technologies from working properly. This project will develop techniques to build collaboration applications that are end-to-end secure, and protect privacy. We will quantify how secure and effective they are, working with investigative journalists who need high levels of security in their collaboration applications.

>Funding is available for a 4-year PhD studentship working on this project, providing a standard stipend and fees (at UK/EU rate). The project will be supervised by Dr Steven Murdoch and will start in October 2018 (unless agreed otherwise).

>To apply, see instructions at <http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/prospective_students/phd_programme/funded_scholarships/#c31028>

*Expiry date for opening*: 5 August 2018 with references required by 12 August 2018

### 2 Postdoc positions in Computational Privacy

*Contact name*: Yves-Alexandre de Montjoye

*Location*: London, UK

*Institution*: Imperial College London

*Contact information*: [deMontjoye@imperial.ac.uk](mailto:deMontjoye@imperial.ac.uk)

*Research areas of interest*:
> The CPG is interested in applying techniques from statistical physics and machine learning to large and complex datasets to expose privacy risks. The CPG’s research projects usually include a mix of theoretical and empirical work with large-scale mobile-phone data, credit card transaction data, healthcare data etc. The group often collaborates with large industry partners in order to access rich datasets. See also: https://cpg.doc.ic.ac.uk


*Positions available/funding opportunities*:
> (Opening 1) PostDoc in Computational Privacy (international).
> The CPG is looking for a candidate with experience in computational privacy and/or applied statistical physics. The research project will be defined in close collaboration with the successful candidate. For example, a possible project could be the development of techniques and software to help utilise large-scale behavioural data while preventing attacks compromising individuals’ privacy.

> (Opening 2) PostDoc in Machine Learning for Privacy (international).
> The CPG is looking for a candidate with experience in the development and application of machine learning techniques. The research project will be defined in close collaboration with the successful candidate. For example, possible projects could include the development of a rigorous framework to profile individuals based on arbitrary data or the analysis of risks when data collected to train an algorithm for automatic decision making is collected from users who may have nefarious intentions.
