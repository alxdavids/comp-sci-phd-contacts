This page serves as an entry point for aspiring graduate students (and post-docs) who are searching for positions in the broad field of information security. We are maintaining an up-to-date [list](#current-positions) of contacts who are advertising current positions in the field. The list is intentionally global in scale &ndash; our goal is to help increase the number of students applying to undertake doctoral and post-doctoral in all aspects of information security research.

**We are looking to update the positions that we have available for new students. All past positions displayed on this website (and in the original [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17r18cKaMSeZF4fI7UZYV0QwCvdbEb3vy3BMNZfgbgzI/edit)) have been moved [here](https://github.com/alxdavids/info-sec-contacts/blob/master/PAST-POSITIONS.md). If a previously advertised position is still active, inform us using the method [below](#adding-entries-to-list).**
