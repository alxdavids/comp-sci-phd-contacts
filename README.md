This page serves as an entry point for aspiring graduate students (and post-docs) who are looking for positions in the broad field of *information security*. We are maintaining an up-to-date [list](#current-positions) of contacts who are advertising current positions in the field. 

## Background

All past positions displayed on this website (and in the original [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17r18cKaMSeZF4fI7UZYV0QwCvdbEb3vy3BMNZfgbgzI/edit)) have been moved [here](https://github.com/alxdavids/info-sec-contacts/blob/master/PAST-POSITIONS.md). *If a previously advertised position is still active, please inform us using the method [below](#adding-entries-to-list).*
