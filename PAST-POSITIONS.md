Computer security with a focus on cryptographic protocols and secure code/systems design; special topics include usable authentication, mobile device security, and digital identity  
Note: We do not have any open funded staff positions or scholarships at this time (new funding may become available in 2018, and we will update this note if it does). Johannes Kepler University Linz is open to PhD students, but at the moment students would have to be self-funded. Such self-funding would need to cover 3-5 years of tuition (depending on the student’s nationality and other conditions, see http://www.jku.at/content/e262/e256786/e233509/e249123?showlang=eng) and living expenses in Linz, Austria (price levels are comparable to other major central European cities).

My group performs research on cybersecurity areas such as cyber physical systems security, malware analysis, fraud and anomaly detection. We have funding for temporary positions in most areas. Other groups work on applied cryptography and other security areas.  
Polimi offers degrees in engineering at all levels, and welcomes foreign students with low tuition and special scholarships.  
  
Bruno Crispo, Fabio Massacci  
University of Trento, Italy  
The group current interest are in malware analysis, mobile and biometrics (Bruno), malware and vulnerability analysis, empirical risk assessment, security requirements engineering and security economics (Fabio), other groups works on security testing (Paolo Tonella at nearby FBK) and formal methods (Silvio Ranise again at FBK). We do have three-years fellowships for most positions but we typically ask wanna-be phd students to come for a 6-months internship.

University of Milan, Italy  
My research group is working on several research security area. More in particular our research deals with Host Intrusion Detection Systems (HIDS), memory error exploits, reverse engineering, malware and forensic analysis. In recent years we’ve mainly studied the application of emulation/virtualization and compiler techniques for malware analysis and detection. In addition we’ve been working on analyzing large-scale security datasets (e.g., Anubis malware collection) to investigate the behavior of current cyber threats. We are open for any internship and Ph.D application.

6 fully-funded PhD opportunities in the School of Computer Science at the University of St Andrews.  Any topic related to functional programming, parallelism, real-time, security etc. with a programming language angle is interesting to us, including types for reasoning about security, energy, time and other systems properties, refactoring, software engineering etc, including Haskell, Erlang and Scala.  We have excellent connections with the UK and international research communities, coordinate the EU Horizon 2020 RePhrase project (http://www.rephrase-ict.eu) and coordinate a project that aims to commercialise previous research results in refactoring-based parallelisation (http:www.paraformance.com).  
  
We are also open to research visitors of all kinds, including sabbaticals etc, and anticipate increasing our permanent academic staff in line with increasing student numbers.
